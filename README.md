Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers
====================================

This repository contains implementation of the [DGHV homomorphic scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616.pdf) and implementation of the [DGHV homomorphic scheme with compressed public-key](http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/440.pdf).

The implementation is done with the [SAGE](http://www.sagemath.org) mathematical library under Python.
